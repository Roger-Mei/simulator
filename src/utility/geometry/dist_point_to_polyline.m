function [dmin,dout,pout,pidx] = dist_point_to_polyline(p,P)
% Function: [dmin,dout,pout,pidx] = dist_point_to_polyline(p,P)
%
% Given a point p (2-by-1) and a polyline (2-by-m), return a 1-by-m vector
% of the closest distances from the point to the polyline and (optionally)
% the minimum distance, the closest point on the polyline to p, and the
% index of the line segment on which the closest point lies (if the index
% is m, then the closest point is the last point of the polyline P)
%
% The polyline is P consists of m-1 line segments, from the first to m-1
% points "Pa" to the second to mth points "Pb" so the output distances are
% to these m-1 line segments and to the last point of Pb.
