# simulator

This is a set of tools for simulating a rigid body robot in MATLAB. The three key components for this simulator are:

1) Agent: the robot to be simulated. See agent2D.m for an overview.

2) Planner/s: the planning algorithm/s that are used to conduct the agent through a simulated environment. See planner2D.m for the overview.

3) World: the environment that the agent must navigate through. See world2D.m for an overview.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you'll need MATLAB. Additional necessary toolboxes will be listed here soon.

## Getting Started

Make sure simulator2D and all subfolders are on your path, and you're ready to go!

Examples will be added soon.
