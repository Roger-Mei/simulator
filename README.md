# simulator

This is a set of tools for simulating a rigid body robot in MATLAB. The three key components for this simulator are:

1) Agent: the robot to be simulated. See agent.m for an overview.

2) Planner/s: the planning algorithm/s that are used to navigate the agent through a simulated environment. See planner.m for the overview.

3) World/s: the environment/s that the agent must navigate through. See world.m for an overview.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you'll need MATLAB. Additional necessary toolboxes will be listed here soon.

## Getting Started

Make sure the simulator repo and all subfolders are on your path, and you're ready to go!

Some example code is available here: https://github.com/ramvasudevan/RTD
